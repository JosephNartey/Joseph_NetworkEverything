Link 4:


Chapter 4 of linked focuses primary on two varying views of network structures.
It is interesting to see two similar but conceptually different views evolve as the author gave
room for the reader to understand Granovetter’s argument about the existence of a real network that 
is not random as depicted by Erdos and Renyi.  Granovetter’s society or idea of networks is seen as 
fragmented web of fully connected clusters communicating through weak ties that are truer to our daily
experience than the completely random picture offered by Erdos and Renyi. From this chapter, we learn an
understanding of networks does not only depend on understanding the relationships that exists among humans
but also relations between other living organism such as crickets and fireflies and nature as a whole. 
What makes this links or ties stronger or even weaker? What draws crickets closer? What ties enable lots of 
fireflies to synchronize and give off light the way they do? How did we hear about our recent job?  What is my Erdos’ number?
Are these activities random or they happen because of the weak ties that exist? It is intriguing to realize that such underlying 
questions form the basis for mathematical proofs that will become the sole basis for developing emerging computer network structure 
that will become real and less magical over time.
