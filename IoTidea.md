IOT Idea


Know the traffic

An IoT device that uses infrared distance detection sensor to counts the number of cars on the road and reports finding to the drivver in car by means of led communicaton. For example, red means more car on road and higher probability of traffic, yellow means just enough cars on the raod and green means very few cars on the road. 

This device is useful because when drivers have idea of how busy a route is, it helps them to drive fast or slow to get to destination in time. There is no need to use a phone while driving as the led, blinking is autonomously done by wifi communication.
