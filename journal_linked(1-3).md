Linked (1-3)
I find Linked an interesting and easy to read book. One would expect to come across complex computer networking languages and mathematical equations when reading a book related to the subject of computer science. However, the author used basic examples of real life hack stories in addition to basic math concepts to explain complicated scenarios in the book, making the booking understandable to any reader irrespective of the field of study or background. 
For instance, the book broke down the concept of the Understanding Networks where he offered historical background concerning Euler’s Contributions solving the problem of the Konigsberg Bridges. According to linked, Euler remarkably represent each city with a node and the links between the cities with an edge creating a graph to represent the problem of the Konigsberg Bridges. His approach shows that “graphs or networks is key to understanding the complex world around us”. Beyond the physical problem of the Konigsberg Bridges, Euler gave more understanding into how it is important not to think too much of the resources required to solve a problem but focus on understanding a problem through modeling before solving it or building the final bridge. 
In my own opinion, Computer Networks are the core to future computing as we see from the evolution of social media platforms of the 21st century. In addition, the evolution of 5G networks, IP V 6 and the concept of “Internet of Things” aims at connecting almost everything to the internet improving our standard of life through speed, reliability and efficiency. The more these networks grow, protocol and architectural demands grow as well making Computer Networking a hot cake field to explore.
