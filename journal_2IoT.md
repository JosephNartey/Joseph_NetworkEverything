Useless:  HidrateSpark


A smart water bottle that glows to make sure that you never forget to drink your water again. The uselessness is inherent in the fact that the concept of drinking when one is thirsty is unfashionable. What if am thirsty and the water bottle doesnâ€™t glow to remind me? There is no intelligence unit embedded to track body hydration level hence is one useless device built for the fun of it. Oh and it has a little robotic arm to tap on your thick head.
